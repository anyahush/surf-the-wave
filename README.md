### Changes to Wireframes



## Surface Plane

During initial stages of development, I carried out research to explore what other surf websites looked like. From what I found, most surf websites are fairly simple in design, following standard layouts of e-commerce sites. In particular, I found two sites that I have taken inspiration from in the design and colour schemes; [Surfdome](https://www.surfdome.com/) and [Shore](https://www.shore.co.uk/).

### Colour Scheme

As mentioned above, I used inspiration from other surf websites whilst choosing the colour schemes. I decided that blue, an obvious choice with the correlation to water, and yellow, due to its bright and uplifting colour and it can represent the sun. 

Initially I chose two colours that I wanted to use. They are Yellow Orange and Cornflower Blue.

![Cornflower Blue colour](readme/assets/readme-images/cornflower-blue.png)

Following this, I used [Coolers](https://coolors.co/) to create a palette of complimentary colours.
